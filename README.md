# DatabaseProject
This project was assigned to me as a student at Universidade Franciscana (UFN). We were tasked with developing a brief summary of the relationship between a database and its database management system (DBMS).

The project has both a PT-BR (Brazilian Portuguese) and an SAE (Standard American English) version.

This summary includes a concise explanation of what a database is, the unique features of different DBMSs (Database Management Systems), and their management mechanisms. During my research, I came across the acronym ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), which is related to the general topic, so I decided to elaborate on it.

The formatting standard for both versions follows ABNT (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas), the official Brazilian academic formatting norm. Even though this is not a formal research paper, I still opted to use it for the sake of practice.

The tools used were Microsoft Word (Office 2021), ChatGPT-4o, and the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary.
